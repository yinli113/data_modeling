# Sparkify Data Modeling with Postgres


## Introduction
### Sparkify is a startup company that has launched a new music streaming app. They have been collecting data on user activity within their app and are now looking to gain insights from this data. However, they lack an efficient way to query and analyze this data, which is currently stored in JSON logs and metadata files. To address this challenge, Sparkify has brought in a data engineer to design a Postgres database and build an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to facilitate the analysis of song plays and user activities. The primary goal of this project is to enable Sparkify's analytics team to answer key questions and make data-driven decisions.

## Project Description
### In this project, the data engineer's task is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline to support Sparkify's analytical goals. The project involves the following key steps:

1. Database Schema Design
sql_queries.py: This file contains SQL statements to create tables, drop tables if they exist, and other SQL-related functions.
create_tables.py: Running this script creates the Postgres database and tables based on the defined schema in sql_queries.py.
test.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook used for testing, and it confirms the successful creation of tables with the correct columns by running SQL queries. Remember to "Restart kernel" to close the database connection after running this notebook.
2. ETL Processes
For each table (fact and dimension), ETL processes are defined. This includes extracting data from JSON files, transforming it as necessary, and loading it into the appropriate tables.
After implementing each ETL process, you can validate it by running the relevant section in test.ipynb.
3. ETL Pipeline
The ETL pipeline processes the entire dataset, automating the extraction, transformation, and loading of data.
The pipeline is executed using the etl.py script, which processes the data in both the song and log datasets.
You can confirm the successful insertion of records into the database tables by running the relevant sections in test.ipynb.
4. Sanity Tests
In the final step of the project, you run the sanity tests in the "Sanity Tests" section of the test.ipynb notebook.
These tests check for column data types, primary key constraints, not-null constraints, and look for on-conflict clauses where required.

### If any of the test cases identifies an issue, a warning message is displayed in orange, indicating the problem that needs to be addressed.

## Purpose of the Database
### The purpose of the database in the context of the startup, Sparkify, is to provide a robust and efficient platform for analyzing user activity and song data. This database will help Sparkify achieve the following analytical goals:

**Song Play Analysis: The database will allow the analytics team to analyze when and which songs users are listening to. This will help answer questions like:**

- What are the most popular songs on the platform?
- When are users most active on the app?
- Are there any trends or patterns in song plays based on time, location, or user demographics?

**User Behavior Analysis: By storing user activity logs, the database will enable the team to understand user behavior. Key insights may include:**

- User engagement metrics, such as the frequency of interactions and session duration.
- User preferences, such as favorite genres or artists.
- User demographics, helping Sparkify tailor its services to different user segments.
- Content Recommendation: Analysis of user interactions with songs and artists will assist Sparkify in recommending personalized content to users. The database will support recommendations based on user history and preferences.

**Platform Performance Monitoring: The database will also facilitate monitoring and optimizing the platform's performance. This includes tracking system uptime, load times, and other technical metrics that can impact the user experience.**
